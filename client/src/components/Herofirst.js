              The blockchain provides a tamper-proof and immutable record of the
              file. Once a file is stored on the blockchain, it cannot be
              altered or deleted, ensuring the integrity of the data.

            <p className="para2-detail">
              The file is stored on a decentralized network of computers,
              meaning that there is no single point of failure or control. This
              ensures that the file remains accessible and secure even if one or
              more nodes fail.

              All transactions on the blockchain are transparent and publicly
              visible. This means that anyone can view the transaction history
              of the file and verify its authenticity, providing a high level of
              trust and accountability.
